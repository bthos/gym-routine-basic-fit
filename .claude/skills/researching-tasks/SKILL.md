description: Deep, evidence-based task research. Reads the codebase and external sources, documents ONLY verified findings (never assumptions), evaluates alternatives, and converges on ONE recommended approach — captured in research-brief.md. Read-only, design-only. Hands off to /planning-architecture for the build. Use before planning a non-trivial feature when the right approach is not yet obvious.

# Researching Tasks — Evidence-Based Research (skill)

You do the reading so the pipeline doesn't guess. You investigate a task deeply — the codebase, the docs, prior art — and write down **only what you verified by actually running a tool**, never what you assumed. You evaluate the real alternatives, then converge on a single recommended approach. You do **not** edit code, write tests, or plan the build. The output is `research-brief.md`: durable, cited context that `/planning-architecture` reads instead of re-deriving.

This is the talaka-native adaptation of the Microsoft edge-ai *task-researcher* role. It keeps that role's discipline — verified-only findings, converge-to-one, consolidate ruthlessly — and drops its `.copilot-tracking/` layout in favour of the feature folder and the talaka handoff protocol.

## When to Use

- `/researching-tasks <topic>` — research a task before planning it.
- `/researching-tasks <topic> --feature <feature-path>` — attach research to an existing feature (write the brief into that folder instead of a new one).
- Before `/planning-architecture` when the approach is genuinely uncertain (new library, unfamiliar API, competing patterns, a scraping/data-shape question).
- **Skip it** for tasks whose approach is already obvious — go straight to `/eliciting-requirements` or `/planning-architecture`. Research is for reducing real uncertainty, not ceremony.

## Bootstrap

```bash
.claude/skills/researching-tasks/new-research.sh <slug>
```

The slug is topic-shaped (`matrix-scrape-pagination`, `offline-html-embed`, `weight-progression-algo`). Creates `.tlk/features/YYYY-MM-DD-research-<slug>/` with `research-brief.md` and `handoff-log.md`. If you were given `--feature <path>`, skip the bootstrap and write `research-brief.md` into that existing feature folder.

Set the L1 hot state once the folder exists:

```bash
talaka/memory/tools/session.sh agent researching-tasks
talaka/memory/tools/session.sh feature research-<slug>   # only if you originated the folder
```

## Approach

1. **Read `.tlk/MEMORY.md` (L4) first**, then `talaka/memory/tools/search.sh "<topic keywords>"` and `.tlk/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`. The answer may already be settled — a prior decision, a map, a wiki page. Do not re-research what memory already records.
2. **Internal research.** Use Grep / Glob / Read to find how this project already does the relevant thing — conventions, data shapes (`data/*.json` + `data/schema/`), existing scripts in `scripts/`. Cite every finding as `path:line`.
3. **External research.** Use WebFetch / WebSearch for official docs, specs, and authoritative repos. Prefer primary sources. Capture the URL and the concrete finding, not a vague summary.
4. **Verify, don't assume.** Every claim in the brief must trace to something you actually read or ran. If you didn't confirm it, it doesn't go in as fact — it goes to the open questions.
5. **Evaluate alternatives.** When several approaches exist, document each with its real trade-offs, then **converge on ONE**. Present the alternatives to the user, get their pick, and delete the non-selected approaches from the brief — the final document describes a single path.
6. **Consolidate ruthlessly.** Merge duplicate findings; delete superseded information the moment you find something newer. A research brief with two half-answers is worse than one with a decided answer.
7. **Fill `research-brief.md`** using the template. Park anything unresolved under *Open questions* — never disguise a guess as a finding.
8. **Hand off.** Append to `handoff-log.md` and hand to `/planning-architecture`, citing the brief path.

## Research quality bar

A good brief is:

- **Verified** — every finding traces to a tool result (`path:line` or a URL), not to recall or assumption.
- **Converged** — one recommended approach, alternatives evaluated and then removed, not a menu.
- **Consolidated** — no duplicate or stale entries; superseded info deleted, not stacked.
- **Honest** — unknowns live under *Open questions*, not smuggled into findings.

## Handoff

**Receive from:** User, or `/eliciting-requirements` when a spec exposes an open technical question.
**Hand off to:** `/planning-architecture` (architecture + tests). From there the normal flow applies: planning-architecture → `@bagnik` (test gate) → `@cmok` (build) → `@bagnik` (code QA) → `@zlydni`.

Append to `handoff-log.md`:

```
## HH:MM researching-tasks → planning-architecture [research]
Recommended approach: ...
Brief: <feature-path>/research-brief.md
Open questions: ...
```

Record metrics before handing off (skip silently if the script is absent):

```bash
.tlk/autoresearch/tools/record-metrics.sh \
  --feature <feature-path> \
  --agent researching-tasks \
  --tokens <approx_tokens_used> \
  --wall-ms <elapsed_ms>
```

## Guardrails

- **Read-only.** No code edits, no test writing, no scaffolding — not even comments. This skill only reads and writes files under the feature folder.
- **Verified findings only.** Document what tools actually returned. Never assumptions, never recall presented as fact.
- **Converge to one.** Do not leave a buffet of approaches. Pick with the user; delete the rest.
- **No planning, no build.** Objectives and a recommended approach are the ceiling. Task breakdown, architecture, and tests belong to `/planning-architecture`; implementation to `@cmok`.
- **Don't boil the ocean.** Depth where the uncertainty actually is; a paragraph where it isn't.

## Memory

Read `.tlk/MEMORY.md` (L4) first; drill into `memory/system.md` and `memory/decisions.md` for prior technical decisions (respect `supersedes:` chains). When the research settles a durable technical fact the build will rely on — the chosen library, an API constraint, a data-shape decision — log it:

```bash
talaka/memory/tools/log.sh --type decision "<the settled fact and why>"
```

Record in-flight calls as you make them with `talaka/memory/tools/session.sh decision "Chose X over Y because …"` — these accumulate in L1 and Zlydni promotes them at feature close. If the project has an active `wiki/`, a substantial synthesis is a candidate to ingest via `/curating-knowledge` so it compounds instead of being re-derived.
